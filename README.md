# JWU LED PAINTER
---
#### Description
The JWU LED Painter is a WS series based led panel driven by an arduino and a Leap Motion connected to a laptop to track where a user's finger is located. The location on the user's finger is used to creat a painting effect by lighting the pixels that are closest to the user's finger tip making it look like they are "painting" onto the panel without actually touching it.
